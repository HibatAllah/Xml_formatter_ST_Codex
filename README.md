# RSpec JUnit Formatter

[RSpec][rspec] results that [Hudson][hudson] can read. Probably a few other CI servers, too.

Inspired by the work of [Diego Souza][dsouza] on [RSpec Formatters][dsouza/rspec_formatters] after frustration with [CI Reporter][ci_reporter].

## Usage

Install the gem:

    gem install rspec_junit_formatter

Use it:

    rspec --format RspecJunitFormatter  --out rspec.xml

You'll get an XML file with your results in it.

## More Permanent Usage

Add it to your Gemfile if you're using [Bundler][bundler].

In your .rspec, usually alongside another formatter, add:

if you use Rspec V1.0 you found  the ". rspec " on this path  :

    /var/liv/gems/1.8/gems/ffi-1.0-11/spec/spec.opts where you should add the 2 lines :
    
    --format RspecJunitFormatter
    --out rspec.xml

I use it with the excellent [Fuubar formatter][fuubar].

## Roadmap

 * It would be nice to split things up into individual test suites, although would this correspond to example groups? The subject? The spec file? Not sure yet.
 * This would sit nicely in rspec-core, and has been designed to do so.
